# JETFLIX a MERN Stack App

JETFLIX was my first group project for my Software Engineering Immersive course. We created a full-stack MERN application built with a Mongo database and React front-end.

### Project Members: 


### Code Installation

- Clone or download Repo
- Install dependencies yarn 
- Start the database mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
- Change Directory to backend and yarn start
- Change Directory to client and run the frontend, yarn start



### Brief & Timeframe

Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
Have a visually impressive design
Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible
Timeframe: 8 days

### Technologies Used: 

Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose
JavaScript (ES6)
React.js
JWT
Bcrypt
Axios
Git + GitHub
Bulma CSS Framework
react-semantic-ui CSS Framework

## Planning 

Our group was picked at random and once we came together I initially had an idea of what to do for the project before hearing my groups idea. Luckily everyone liked my idea and thus we created JETFLIX. We started our planning off by drawing on one of my partners whtoeboards and sketching out each page we wanted throughout or application,.
